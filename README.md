# Dragonfly-Optimization
Cloud computing has transformed how computing resources are managed and utilized, delivering benefits such as optimized infrastructure use, increased flexibility, and faster deployment times. Despite these advantages, achieving seamless interoperability across diverse cloud environments remains a significant challenge, especially in terms of ensuring smooth resource sharing and access in heterogeneous systems. Containers have emerged as a lightweight virtualization solution that enhances scalability, portability, and flexibility in cloud services. However, issues such as energy efficiency and effective data migration in these diverse environments persist. The proposed solution employs the Adaptive Dragonfly Optimization (ADrO) algorithm for efficient data migration. While the traditional Dragonfly optimization algorithm is prone to local optima trapping due to loss of population diversity, this limitation is addressed by integrating a Levy flight strategy, enhancing population diversity and accelerating convergence toward optimal solutions. In the migration process, user tasks are collected, organized, and assigned to containers, ensuring efficient resource allocation. Additionally, load prediction is performed using an Actor-Critic Neural Network (ACNN) to further optimize migration decisions, accounting for predicted load and system capacity. A multi-objective function is developed to evaluate migration based on parameters such as predicted load transmission cost, demand, resource capacity, agility, reputation, migration time, and energy consumption. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations and comparisons with other methods. The proposed energy-efficient data migration framework is implemented using Python, showcasing its potential to enhance performance in container-based heterogeneous cloud environments.
